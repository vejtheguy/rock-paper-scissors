## Description

This project is a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game that runs directly in the DOM. Players make their choice using on-screen buttons, which update dynamically as the game progresses. The player competes against the computer in a best-of-five match, with round results and scores displayed on the page. Once a winner is decided, the game offers the option to replay.

2. When prompted, choose `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
3. Click `next round` and continue playing until you are the computer wins the best-of-five.
